			<p>The Street Chemist is a master of mysterious liquids. As their life has been mostly outside, surviving grim situations in shady alleyways, most of their knowledge is self-thought or copied from others. One skill in particular peaks their interest, the act of crafting and brewing various chemical substances. Whether it is combining plants and berries into a powerful poison, or distilling oil and other liquids into an intensely flammable liquid, the Street Chemist has learned it all through watching others work, eavesdrop on everyday conversations, and most importantly, a lot of trial and error.</p>

			<p>You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.</p>
